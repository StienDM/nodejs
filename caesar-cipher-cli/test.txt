The English Wikipedia is the English-language edition of the free online encyclopedia Wikipedia.
Founded on 15 January 2001, it is the first edition of Wikipedia and, as of April 2019,
has the most articles of any edition. As of October 2020, 11% of articles in all Wikipedias belong to
the English-language edition. This share has gradually declined from more than 50 percent in 2003,
due to the growth of Wikipedias in other languages. As of 3 October 2020, there are 6,167,809 articles on the site,
having surpassed the 6 million mark on 23 January 2020.
In August 2019, the total volume of the compressed texts of the English Wikipedia's
articles amounted to 16.1 gigabytes.
